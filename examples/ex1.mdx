Hello,
My name is Susan. I'm fourteen and I live in Germany. My hobbies are going to discos, sometimes I listen to music on the radio. In the summer I go bathing in a lake. I don't have any brothers or sisters. We take buses to school. I am in year 9 at my school. My birthday is on Friday. I hope I will get a new guitar.
I'm looking forward to getting an email from you.

Yours,
Susan
